# This is an example config file, showing all the options. You probably 
# won't need most of them. Your working config file will be named 
# "pyTivo.conf". '#' starts a comment.  It is recommended that
# that you use the Web Administration tool to modify pyTivo.conf after
# you get pyTivo up and running.  You can access the tool by pointing your
# browser to http://localhost:9032/

# Read the pyTivo support wiki for additional help at 
# http://pytivo.sourceforge.net

[Server]
# This is the port that pyTivo's http server uses for its webinterface
# it defaults to 9032 if not specified here.

# Your Media Access Key is needed for all togo functionality and also
# to decode .tivo files to be uploaded to the TiVo. A value must be
# specified here to enable togo functionality (along with a path in the
# togo section).

# If either tivolibre or tivodecode are available you can specify where

# Beacon broadcast address(es)
# The default is 255.255.255.255, but on some multihomed machines you 
# may need to specify the subnet broadcast address(es) of your Tivo 
# boxes. You can also specify "listen" to listen for direct connection 
# attempts on port 2190, for use with the "Manually add a server..." 
# function. (And if you set beacon to listen _only_, it turns off 
# broadcasts.)

# The ts setting says to tell the TiVo it should request a transport stream
# download (upload from pyTivo) of a video. Use auto to let pyTivo
# determine what to tell the TiVo based on the file's extension, or
# True/False (also On/Off) to force what is sent to the TiVo.
# auto is the default if not specified

# Current TiVos (as of June 2017 at least) have a bug where the Transport stream (TS)
# data being sent is corrupted (losing sync), pytivo can attempt to recognize the
# corruption and try again.
# The togo_ts_error_mode may be set one of the following:
#   ignore : Ignore any errors encountered and just save what is sent
#   reject : abort the download as soon as an error is detected
#   best   : keep the file with the least number of errors detected
